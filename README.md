# Automated-S3-Bucket-Security-Compliance-Checker
> Technologies: AWS SDK, AWS Lambda, Amazon S3, AWS CloudFormation, AWS IAM, Python or another preferred programming language

## Objectives:

### Automate Security Policy Compliance: Use infrastructure-as-code to continuously check S3 buckets for compliance with predefined security policies, such as encryption, public access restrictions, and logging.

### Integrate IAM Policies: Utilize AWS IAM to manage permissions and roles for accessing and modifying S3 bucket policies, ensuring only authorized personnel can make changes.

### Real-Time Alerting: Implement real-time alerts for non-compliance issues, sending notifications to relevant stakeholders.

### Report Generation: Provide periodic reports on compliance status, including details of any non-compliance issues and actions taken.
    
### Remediation Automation: Optionally, create automated remediation scripts to correct non-compliant buckets (if within the scope of the project).
